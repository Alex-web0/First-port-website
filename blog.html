        <p class="text-md p-3">The Fashion Guitar is the online home of Dutch-born Charlotte Groeneveld-Van Haren. Charlotte is now a New York-based mother of two.

            Charlotte had worked with several fashion blogs in a former job, so decided that she would like to create one herself. With the arrival of her children, she also started to cater to mothers and mothers-to-be.
            
            </p>
        <p class="text-md p-3">Charlotte loves the opportunity to work with her favorite brands and designers – but she only collaborates if she feels a genuine connection.</p>

      <p class="text-md p-3">Fashion is a highly visual industry, which explains why Instagram is the social network of choice for lovers of style. But there is far more fashion content online than what people share on social media. It has always been a strong niche for blogging.

        There are many quality fashion blogs, which unsurprisingly feature high-quality photographs of the latest fashion innovations.  Most fashion blogs are full of inspiration for those mornings you open your wardrobe door with your mind in a blank. They make an ideal place to begin your online research into what’s hot this year before you head off to purchase your own outfits. They can also provide you with ideas about what you can mix and match to create that perfect look.
        
        The successful online fashion bloggers are as much influencers as the big names who post fashion images on Instagram. Indeed, most of these fashion bloggers have an active Instagram presence as well.</p>
      <p class="text-md p-3">Atlantic-Pacific’s creator, Blair Eadie can be considered a real fashion influencer. She started as a Gap Inc merchandiser 11 years ago and has been part of the fashion world ever since. She has built up a substantial social media following, including over 1.1 million Instagram followers.

        Blair recognized how street style was shaping fashion and created Atlantic-Pacific in 2010 to help develop the conversation. Since then she has noticed the industry reshape from the inside out.
        
        She has worked as an influencer with many brands, including CoverGirl, Gucci, Nordstrom, Target, Tory Burch, Sephora, and many more. She has also collaborated on global campaigns with luxury brands such as Vogue, Elle, Harper’s Bazaar, Who What Wear, Refinery 29, Style Watch, and more.
        
        She has ensured that Atlantic-Pacific is a highly visual platform, showcasing eye-catching fashion.</p>
